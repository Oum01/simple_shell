# OUR SIMPLE SHELL  project

This is the project where we create our own shell commands


## Description

our shell provides a basic command line interface where users can input single-word commands, execute them, and see the results. It ensures error handling and prompt repetition after each command execution, while also accounting for the end-of-file condition.i

```bash
